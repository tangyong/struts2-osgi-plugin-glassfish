Using Struts2 OSGi plugin with GlassFish

[Background]

Please seeing http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14200300/using-struts2-osgi-plugin-with-glassfish

[Enviroment]

1 struts 2.3.1 tag
Note: I will firstly extend 2.3.1 as an experiment, then rebase such extending into struts trunk.
As a convenient, I will upload structs 2.3.1(struts2 OSGi plugin's source is included in struts) into this repo

2 glassfish v4 trunk

3 Struts2OSGi demo

The demo is from http://code.google.com/p/class-reloading-test/ 
About detailed info about the demo, please seeing http://classreloadingwebapp.blogspot.gr/2012/04/class-reloading-4-using-struts2-osgi.html
As a convenient, I will also upload the demo into this repo

4 jdk7

Because glassfish v4 trunk's building requires jdk7, I must use jdk7

5 maven 3.0.4

[Design]

ToDo
